          <h3 id="c511">5.1.1 Kingman Economic Region</h3>
        <p>
            The Kingman Economic Region comprises eight zip codes that encompass 2,133 square miles, which contained about {{ context_dict['population']['Kingman city, Arizona'] | int | comma_separated }} people in {{ context_dict['acs_year'] }}. This region has the highest population density of the three geographies detailed in this report at {{ context_dict['pop_density:Kingman city, Arizona'] }} persons per square mile, who compose a total of {{ context_dict['total_households']['Kingman city, Arizona'] | int | comma_separated }} households, with a household size of {{ context_dict['avg_hh_size']['Kingman city, Arizona'] }}. The Kingman poverty rate is {{ context_dict['poverty_rate']['Kingman city, Arizona'] }}%.
        </p>    
        <p>
            Approximately {{ context_dict['pct_hh_between_15_50']['Kingman city, Arizona'] }}% of these households earn between $15,000 to $50,000. Total employment in this economic region is {{ context_dict['employment']['Kingman city, Arizona'] | int | comma_separated }} persons, with an average income of ${{ context_dict['per_capita_income']['Kingman city, Arizona'] | int | comma_separated }}. The Kingman Economic Region's significant employers include Kingman Regional Medical Center, American Woodmark Corp., IWX Motor Freight, McKee Foods, Trueserve, Laron, Cantex, and Cascades Tissue.
        </p>
        <p>
            This economic region contains the most diverse of the three and hosts significant manufacturing, transportation, logistics, aviation industries, and healthcare and tourism industries. The Kingman Economic Region must take advantage of its existing critical mass of sectors and continue developing its multimodal transportation options.
        </p>
        <p>
            As ports on the west coast continue to experience more unloading delays, the freight hauling and logistics industries will be looking for alternatives further and further inland, since unloading delays cause massive monetary losses for these industries. Attracting sectors that focus on alternative energy component manufacturing (as opposed to generation) such as solar cells, is also worthy of attention.
        </p>
        <p>
            The leading industries for employment in the Kingman Economic Region are {% for industry, percentage in context_dict['top-industries:Kingman city, Arizona'].items() %}{{ industry }}({{percentage}}%) {% endfor %}.
        </p>
        <p>
            According to the BLS, the most recent unemployment rate for Kingman is {{ context_dict['current_unemployment:Kingman city'][1] }}% in {{ context_dict['current_unemployment:Kingman city'][0] }}. For the same month, the metro unemployment rate was {{ context_dict['current_unemployment_vs_AZ:Kingman city'][0] }}% {{ context_dict['current_unemployment_vs_AZ:Kingman city'][1] }} than the Arizona rate.

         <h3 id="c52">5.2 Greater Yuma County (including La Paz County) Economic Region
        </h3>
        <p>
            High unemployment remains an issue in Yuma. Citing August 2019 data, the Bureau of Labor Statistics ranked Yuma as #1 among the 13 U.S. cities that post unemployment rates above 15 percent. Yuma's agricultural workforce, which adjusts to the picking season, is cited as the reason for the high unemployment by the Arizona Department of Commerce. Yuma County is 5,519 sqaure miles in area and has a population of {{ context_dict['population']['Yuma County, Arizona'] | int | comma_separated }} people, and a population density of {{ context_dict['pop_density:Yuma County, Arizona'] }} people per sqaure mile. Yuma county has a total of {{ context_dict['total_households']['Yuma County, Arizona'] | int | comma_separated }} households, with an average household size of {{ context_dict['avg_hh_size']['Yuma County, Arizona'] }}.
        </p>
        <p>
            La Paz County is 5,519 sqaure miles in area and has a population of {{ context_dict['population']['La Paz County, Arizona'] | int | comma_separated }} people, and a population density of {{ context_dict['pop_density:La Paz County, Arizona'] }} people per sqaure mile. La Paz County has a total of {{ context_dict['total_households']['La Paz County, Arizona'] | int | comma_separated }} households, with an average household size of {{ context_dict['avg_hh_size']['La Paz County, Arizona'] }}.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yuma County has always been seen as a lower wage area. Yuma County also chronically has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country, approaching a high of 30 percent at one time (August 2010). But many of the unemployed lack the training, skills, and certification to fill the better-paying jobs that are available. Companies with the need for more skilled labor come to job fairs, only to leave empty-handed because they can't find qualified applicants.
        </p>
        <p>
            Not only do available jobs go wanting for lack of qualified applicants, but it also means the area has trouble attracting companies that offer better-paying jobs. Yuma County continues to be the destination for the lower-paying jobs. The area must have to have a higher-skilled workforce to attract better-paying jobs. On the other hand, the lack of higher-skilled jobs drives young people to leave the community to seek careers elsewhere. And others who come to Yuma as the military spouses and professionals often cannot find a job here to match their skills.
        </p>
            In Yuma County, {{ context_dict['pct_hh_between_15_50']['Yuma County, Arizona'] }}% of households earn between $15,000 to $50,000, {{ context_dict['employment']['Yuma County, Arizona'] | int | comma_separated }} persons employed total, an average per-capita income of ${{ context_dict['per_capita_income']['Yuma County, Arizona'] | int | comma_separated }}, and {{ context_dict['poverty_rate']['Yuma County, Arizona'] }}% of people living below the poverty level. For La Paz County, {{ context_dict['pct_hh_between_15_50']['La Paz County, Arizona'] }}% of households earn between $15,000 to $50,000, a total employment of {{ context_dict['employment']['La Paz County, Arizona'] | int | comma_separated }} persons, and an average per-capita income of ${{ context_dict['per_capita_income']['La Paz County, Arizona'] | int | comma_separated }}. The poverty rate in La Paz County is {{ context_dict['poverty_rate']['La Paz County, Arizona'] }}%.
        <p>
            The community has made some strides, such as the STEAM (science, technology, engineering, agriculture, and math) program offered by Yuma Union High School District, in partnership with Arizona Western College. In collaboration with the University of Arizona, the college is also making it easier for Yumans to pursue college degrees in engineering. 
        </p>
        <p>
