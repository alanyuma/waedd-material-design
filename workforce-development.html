Further, APCV-498 provides graduating University of Arizona students a culminating experience for majors involving a substantive project that demonstrates a synthesis of learning accumulated in the major, including broadly comprehensive knowledge of the discipline and its methodologies. During the Spring 2021 semester, two UA faculty advisors and five CAST program students dedicated hundreds of hours researching, testing, and deploying HTML, Python code, and Application Programming Interface &#40;API&#41; coding solutions to bind the US Bureau of Labor Statistics &#40;BLS&#41; and US Census Bureau enormous data tables to this CEDS document. The applied computing programming solutions allow this CEDS document to update itself in the background seamlessly and precisely. Thank you, Wildcats!

            The Kingman Economic Region comprises eight zip codes that encompass 2,133 square miles, which contained about 29,726 people in 2019. This region has the highest population density of the three geographies detailed in this report at 13.94 persons per square mile, who compose a total of 11,843 households, with a household size of 2.51. The Kingman poverty rate is 14.3%.
        </p>    
        <p>
            Approximately 38.3% of these households earn between $15,000 to $50,000. Total employment in this economic region is 11,014 persons, with an average income of $27,205.

            This economic region contains the most diverse of the three and hosts significant manufacturing, transportation, logistics, aviation industries, and healthcare and tourism industries. The Kingman Economic Region must take advantage of its existing critical mass of sectors and continue developing its multimodal transportation options.
        </p>
        <p>
            As ports on the west coast continue to experience more unloading delays, the freight hauling and logistics industries will be looking for alternatives further and further inland, since unloading delays cause massive monetary losses for these industries. Attracting sectors that focus on alternative energy component manufacturing &#40;as opposed to generation&#41; such as solar cells, is also worthy of attention.
        </p>
        <p>
            The leading industries for employment in the Kingman Economic Region are Educational services, and health care and social assistance &#40;28.3%&#41; Retail trade &#40;12.4%&#41; Arts, entertainment, and recreation, and accommodation and food services&#40;12.3%&#41; .

         <h3 id="c52">5.2 Greater Yuma County &#40;including La Paz County&#41; Economic Region
        </h3>
        <p>
            High unemployment remains an issue in Yuma. Citing August 2019 data, the Bureau of Labor Statistics ranked Yuma as #1 among the 13 U.S. cities that post unemployment rates above 15 percent. Yuma's agricultural workforce, which adjusts to the picking season, is cited as the reason for the high unemployment by the Arizona Department of Commerce. Yuma County is 5,519 sqaure miles in area and has a population of 209,468 people, and a population density of 37.95 people per sqaure mile. Yuma county has a total of 73,098 households, with an average household size of 2.87.
        </p>
        <p>
            La Paz County is 5,519 sqaure miles in area and has a population of 20,793 people, and a population density of 4.61 people per sqaure mile. La Paz County has a total of 9,346 households, with an average household size of 2.22.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yuma County has always been seen as a lower wage area. Yuma County also chronically has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country, approaching a high of 30 percent at one time &#40;August 2010&#41;. But many of the unemployed lack the training, skills, and certification to fill the better-paying jobs that are available. Companies with the need for more skilled labor come to job fairs, only to leave empty-handed because they can't find qualified applicants.
        </p>
        <p>
            Not only do available jobs go wanting for lack of qualified applicants, but it also means the area has trouble attracting companies that offer better-paying jobs. Yuma County continues to be the destination for the lower-paying jobs. The area must have to have a higher-skilled workforce to attract better-paying jobs. On the other hand, the lack of higher-skilled jobs drives young people to leave the community to seek careers elsewhere. And others who come to Yuma as the military spouses and professionals often cannot find a job here to match their skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Yuma County, 41.1% of households earn between $15,000 to $50,000, 75,903 persons employed total, an average per-capita income of $21,758, and 19.4% of people living below the poverty level. For La Paz County, 41.8% of households earn between $15,000 to $50,000, a total employment of 6,160 persons, and an average per-capita income of $22,879. The poverty rate in La Paz County is 22.4%.
        </p>
        <p>
            The community has made some strides, such as the STEAM &#40;science, technology, engineering, agriculture, and math&#41; program offered by Yuma Union High School District, in partnership with Arizona Western College. In collaboration with the University of Arizona, the college is also making it easier for Yumans to pursue college degrees in engineering. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The top ten employers in Yuma County based on number of employees are: #1 U.S. Army Proving Ground &#40;YPG&#41; &#40;military&#41;; #2 Yuma Regional Medical Center &#40;healthcare&#41;; #3 Yuma Elementary School District &#40;education&#41; #4 Wal-Mart Stores &#40;retail&#41;; #5 City of Yuma &#40;government&#41;; #6 Yuma County &#40;government&#41;; #7 U.S. Marine Corps Air Station &#40;MCAS&#41; &#40;military&#41;; #8 Bose Corporation &#40;manufacturing&#40;; #9 US Border Patrol &#40;government&#41;; and #10 ACT, Advanced Call Center Technologies &#40;call center.&#41;
        </p>
        <p>
            The unemployment rate in Yuma County is 11.8% as of February 2021, with job growth of - 0.42%. Future job growth over the next ten years is predicted to be 15.46%.
