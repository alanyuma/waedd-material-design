         <h3 id="c52">5.1 Greater Yuma County (including La Paz County) Economic Region
        </h3>
        <p>
            High unemployment remains an issue in Yuma. Citing August 2019 data, the Bureau of Labor Statistics ranked Yuma as #1 among the 13 U.S. cities that post unemployment rates above 15 percent. Yuma's agricultural workforce, which adjusts to the picking season, is cited as the reason for the high unemployment by the Arizona Department of Commerce. Yuma County is 5,519 sqaure miles in area and has a population of 209,468 people, and a population density of 37.95 people per sqaure mile. Yuma county has a total of 73,098 households, with an average household size of 2.87.
        </p>
        <p>
            La Paz County is 5,519 sqaure miles in area and has a population of 20,793 people, and a population density of 4.61 people per sqaure mile. La Paz County has a total of 9,346 households, with an average household size of 2.22.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yuma County has always been seen as a lower wage area. Yuma County also chronically has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country, approaching a high of 30 percent at one time (August 2010). But many of the unemployed lack the training, skills, and certification to fill the better-paying jobs that are available. Companies with the need for more skilled labor come to job fairs, only to leave empty-handed because they can't find qualified applicants.
        </p>
        <p>
            Not only do available jobs go wanting for lack of qualified applicants, but it also means the area has trouble attracting companies that offer better-paying jobs. Yuma County continues to be the destination for the lower-paying jobs. The area must have to have a higher-skilled workforce to attract better-paying jobs. On the other hand, the lack of higher-skilled jobs drives young people to leave the community to seek careers elsewhere. And others who come to Yuma as the military spouses and professionals often cannot find a job here to match their skills.
        </p>
            In Yuma County, 41.1% of households earn between $15,000 to $50,000, 75,903 persons employed total, an average per-capita income of $21,758, and 19.4% of people living below the poverty level. For La Paz County, 41.8% of households earn between $15,000 to $50,000, a total employment of 6,160 persons, and an average per-capita income of $22,879. The poverty rate in La Paz County is 22.4%.
        <p>
            The community has made some strides, such as the STEAM (science, technology, engineering, agriculture, and math) program offered by Yuma Union High School District, in partnership with Arizona Western College. In collaboration with the University of Arizona, the college is also making it easier for Yumans to pursue college degrees in engineering. 
        </p>
        <p>
