                A <strong>$3.2B USD</strong> annual agribusiness industry forms the foundation of Yuma County or more than one-third of Arizona's yearly total of <strong>$9.2B USD</strong>. Yuma's agribusiness sector is responsible for supplying the United States with 80 percent of its winter, leafy vegetables. A variety of industrial, processing and logistics operations take advantage of Yuma's strategic location, increasing Yuma's economic diversity.

                Undisputedly, agriculture is the number one industry for Yuma County. According to a 2013 University of Arizona study, agriculture produces an estimated <strong>$2.5B USD</strong> a year into the Yuma economy. This industry is due to our fertile soil &#40;sediments deposited by the Colorado River over millions of years&#41;, progressive farmers &#40;who explore and utilize the latest theories and technology in their fields&#41;, sufficient labor &#40;highly skilled and motivated workforce&#41;, and senior rights to irrigation water.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lettuce is the largest winter crop in Yuma; it is by no means the only one. There are over 175 different crops grown in the Yuma area year-round! The list includes alfalfa, Bermuda grass seed, cotton, dates, lemons, melons, and wheat. Desert Durum accounts for 95% of the grain grown in Yuma County, and about two-thirds of that is exported to Italy for use in making premium pasta.  
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
                According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, if Yuma County were a country, its <abbr title="gross domestic product">GDP</abbr> &#40;Gross Domestic Product&#41; would rank 151 out of 192 countries. Yes, that's countries.
            </p>
            <p>
                GDP is defined as the monetary value of all finished goods and services produced within a region's borders.  Yuma's <abbr title="gross domestic product">GDP</abbr> for 2018 was calculated at nearly <strong>$8.3B USD</strong>. The government contributed <strong>$1.5B USD</strong> and private industries <strong>$3.8B USD</strong>. The three most significant sectors in the Yuma economy are agriculture, military, and tourism. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Dates are a remarkable fruit and are another essential piece of the Yuma Agriculture industry, just like all the other vegetables grown here. As long as people need to eat, farmers will continue to keep Agriculture the leading sector in Yuma.

            Arizona Department of Transportation announced Yuma International Airport as the <strong>2021 Arizona Airport of the Year</strong> during the Arizona Airports Association &#40;AzAA&#41; annual Spring conference this week &#40;May 3, 2021.&#41;

            During the virtual awards banquet, ADOT’s Aeronautics Group selected Yuma International Airport based on its accomplishments in the areas of community relations, airport management, airport maintenance activities and innovative activities and programs implemented at the airport. Specific recognition was given for its aviation advocacy, economic development, community outreach and airport management.</p>
        <p>
            More than <strong>$45M USD</strong> in public and private funding have been invested in Yuma International Airport over the past ten years. Some of that <strong>$45M USD</strong> has funded improvements to runways, taxiways, parking aprons, the terminal, and other infrastructure to benefit the flying public.
        </p>  
        <p>
            However, much of the focus has been on developing the west side of the airport into the Defense Contractor Complex to provide facilities for both short- and long-term leasing by defense contractors working to support the missions of Yuma's two military installations: Yuma Proving Ground and Marine Corps Air Station Yuma &#40;with critical national defense missions&#41;, as well as aviation giants including Boeing, GE Aviation, Gulfstream, Honda Jet, NASA, Pratt & Whitney, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
        </p> 
        <p>
            The continuation of economic expansion in Yuma County continues to drive economic development strategies for market development aimed at four diversified industries with the highest growth potential. Aviation is one such commercial industry.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Yuma International Airport and Yuma County Airport Authority work closely with the decision-makers in the aerospace industry, other government agencies, and academic institutions to coordinate business development. Besides commercial, general, and military flight operations, Yuma International Airport also has a definite air transport talent, limited aircraft maintenance, airport service, and flight training.
        </p>
        <p>
            Public program funds help local governments and airport authorities plan, design, build and maintain public aviation facilities. An example of an economic development project is an industrial park's facilities at a general airport. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Commercial and general aviation plays a crucial role in stimulating economic growth, employment, and investment in the United States. More than 5,000 U.S. public airports and fewer than 500 have a commercial airline server, making commercial and general aviation very important.

        <h4 id="c431">4.3.1 Marine Corps Air Station Yuma</h4>
        <p>
            Yuma is home to two of the largest military installations in the United States. Marine Corps Air Station Yuma is the country's foremost Marine Air Base with an estimated population of more than 7,500 pilots, aviation technicians, and aeronautical mechanics. The Marine Corps Air Station Yuma's economic impact in the local region in 2017 is <strong>$887M USD</strong>. The U.S. Army Yuma Proving Ground generates an annual economic impact in 2017 of over <strong>$1.1B USD</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <abbr title="marine corps air station yuma">MCAS</abbr> Yuma has the F-35, and Yuma Proving Ground has the U.S. Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School. The military free-fall facility's purpose will allow special forces, troops to train for air operations requiring free falls from airplanes. The facility opened in January of 2014 and, at 75 feet tall, is the largest in the world. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            Yuma's military roots are extensive, and those traditions will not be slowing any time soon. With more than 5,000 Marines and sailors stationed at <abbr title="marine corps air station yuma">MCAS</abbr> Yuma and thousands more that travel there for training, the airbase serves as an integral part of the Yuma economy. Along with the number of Marines and sailors stationed at MCAS Yuma, estimates that there are over 7,000 family members with them, approximately 1,300 civilian employees on base, and most days, an additional 1,000 military members using the facility for training purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The air station annually hosts approximately 70 aviation units, bringing 600 aircraft and 14,000 personnel for ongoing training throughout the year. With access to 2.8 million acres of bombing and aviation training ranges and superb flying weather, <abbr title="marine corps air station yuma">MCAS</abbr> Yuma supports 80 percent of the Corps' air-to-ground aviation training. Each year, the air station hosts numerous units and aircraft from U.S. and <abbr title="north atlantic treaty organization">NATO</abbr> forces.

        <p>
            Yuma Proving Ground &#40;<abbr title="yuma proving ground">YPG</abbr>&#41; is the busiest United States Army testing center in the nation and a huge economic boon for surrounding communities in the District.
        </p>
        <p>
            <abbr title="yuma proving ground">YPG</abbr> takes up about 20 percent of Yuma County and stretches north into La Paz County. <abbr title="yuma proving ground">YPG</abbr> spans about 840,000 acres, the test center is about one-third the size of Massachusetts. About 1,700 employees, mostly civilians, test a wide variety of military hardware, including crewless aircraft, helicopter weapons, artillery, tanks, armored vehicles, machine guns, mortars, and parachutes. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            In a typical year at <abbr title="yuma proving ground">YPG</abbr>, test personnel fire tens of thousands of artillery, mortar, and missile rounds, 36,000 parachute drops take place, over 130,000 miles driven on test vehicles, and nearly 4,000 air sorties flown. YPG is the largest high technology employer in the county and pumps a large amount of cash into the local economy.

            The District's economy has an unusual degree of stability, as the tourism base that many communities depend upon is relatively resistant to economic downturns. District tourism is either relatively low cost, access by motor vehicle recreational tourism from Southern California, and maintains economic recession periods. Recessions only mildly impact winter visitors, snowbirds, R.V. tourism, and fixed income visitors. During the winter months, more than 100,000 winter visitors flock to the Yuma County communities to enjoy sun-drenched warmth.

            Arizona State Parks have a significant economic impact on communities and counties. A state park's value is, of course, not measured by financial impact alone. Parks enhance community quality-of-life and preserve invaluable historical, cultural, and recreational resources for residents and visitors worldwide. However, communities are increasingly recognizing that State Parks improve rural counties' economic well-being and serve as an essential tourism resource.

            Tourism is the third biggest industry in Yuma County. According to documents obtained by the Yuma Visitors Bureau, 2018 saw <strong>$785 million</strong> in Direct Travel Spending. That income created 6,500 jobs, generated <strong>$226M USD</strong> in earnings, and <strong>$67 million</strong> in additional taxes. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Yuma has plenty to offer travelers and tourists alike. However, there is no doubt that Yuma's winters are some of the best in the country and draw most visitors between November and April every year.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just how many winter visitors come tends to be an elusive number. At the peak of our winter visitor season, February, it is estimated we have about 80,000 visitors. February is the peak of the season, as many places on the continent are experiencing some of their coldest temperatures.  
        </p>
        <p>
            However, no matter the numbers, they have a significant impact on the area. Consider that the City of Yuma's year-round population is about 98,000 &#40;2018&#41;. Adding another 80,000 is a marked seasonal influx of people to the community. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Today's winter visitors are not quite the same breed as they were 25 years ago. Our nation's youngest retirees come to Yuma and are highly active! They hit the casinos, browse the swap meets, attend arts and crafts shows, local patron events and fill seats at concerts. They enjoy hiking in the desert, playing golf, and fishing. They visit Mexico for medical and dental treatment and stay to linger over lunch and margaritas.

            Mexican visitors spend an estimated <strong>$2.2B USD</strong> on food, clothing, entertainment, and other activities in Yuma County each year, according to a speaker at an economic forum in 2012. That represents more than 6 percent of all taxable sales. That spending directly supports more than 2,000 local jobs.

            La Paz County signed an agreement with 174 Power Global, a South Korean company, to build a solar energy facility on 4,000 acres. At 850 megawatts, it will be the largest solar project in the nation. It’s estimated 800 to 1,000 construction jobs will be created, with the facility producing enough power for 300,000 homes.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the United States Senate, Senator McSally introduced bipartisan legislation in the form of the La Paz County Land Conveyance Act of 2019, and in the House of Representatives, Representative Gosar introduced companion, bipartisan legislation in the form of S. 54, the La Paz County Land Conveyance Act of 2019, and its companion, bipartisan legislation in the form of H.R. 304.
        </p>
        <p>
            Seven companies have committed to building utility-scale renewable energy plants within three hours of Yuma. According to the Solar Foundation, Arizona is ranked third in the nation for solar. Arizona Western College Solar Array Testing Site provides research on solar energy, thus providing a connection between solar technology and the region. With its dry weather, Arizona is a logical location for solar power. Manufacturers of solar equipment would be expected to locate near places of demand for their products, i.e., solar power production.

            Yuma International Airport, a shared-use airport, and Marine Corps Air Station Yuma are located three nautical miles south of Yuma's central business district. Yuma International Airport is managed and operated by the Yuma County Airport Authority, Inc. &#40;<abbr title="yuma county airport authority">YCAA</abbr>&#41;.   
        </p>
        <p>
            Under Arizona law, an Airport Authority is an independent public agency and incorporated as a non-profit organization in the State of Arizona on December 30, 1965. The <abbr title="yuma county airport authority">YCAA</abbr> management team is composed of experienced aviation professionals and has a long history of providing support to the aviation and aerospace industry.   
        </p>
        <p>
            Yuma International Airport offers reasonably frequent service &#40;American Airlines&#41; to important hubs &#40;Phoenix and Dallas/Fort Worth&#41;. Connections to other destinations are relatively convenient, and airfares are not unreasonable. Federal Express is located on the airport; however, there are no large air cargo operations in Yuma.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Laughlin-Bullhead City Airport is a public airport located one mile north of the central business district of Bullhead City in Mohave County. The airport is across the Colorado River and one block away from the community of Laughlin, Nevada. Many of the rooms at Laughlin's casino-hotels offer a view of the chartered and private flights that utilize the airport. No larger commercial airlines currently serve the airport. It was named 2011 Airport of the Year by the Arizona Department of Transportation. There is now no scheduled commercial air service.
        </p>
        <p>
            Flights to any destination are limited to travel days and frequency. Bullhead City is also served by casino charter flights, which bring tourists to Laughlin from many cities around the country. Still, such trips do not provide for the general or business traveler. Air cargo facilities are not available. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Kingman Airport is a city-owned public airport nine miles northeast of Kingman in Mohave County. It has scheduled service on one airline, subsidized by the Essential Air Service program. Some aircraft are stored or scrapped there. Again, air cargo facilities are not available. No airlines serve the airport as of late 2018.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Lake Havasu City Airport is a city-owned public-use airport located six miles north of Lake Havasu City's central business district, in Mohave County. The airport is mostly used for general aviation. Until May 5, 2007, scheduled service to Phoenix and Las Vegas was provided by Mesa Airlines, operating as U.S. Airways Express. Again, air cargo facilities do not exist.

            Three Interstates traverse the District. Interstate 40 goes east/west through Mohave County and Kingman. Interstate 10 transits east/West through La Paz County and Quartzsite. Interstate 8 traverses southern Yuma County and the communities of Yuma and Wellton.
        </p>
        <p>
            These Interstate corridors provide excellent east/ west access in and out of the District, linking the District to Tucson, Phoenix, Los Angeles, and San Diego. All provide viable commercial transportation corridors for trucking, which constitute an advantageous situation for the District in serving these industrial markets.
        </p>
        <p>
            The only north/south transportation corridor within the District is US/AZ Highway 95, which goes from the Mexican border to Bullhead City, traversing San Luis, Somerton, Yuma, Quartzsite, Parker, and Lake Havasu City. The stretch from San Luis through Yuma is adequate, with some recent improvements having been made. This stretch is a viable commercial corridor.

        <p>
            The Yuma Area Service Highway is a 25-mile-long project extending from the Mexico border near San Luis, Arizona, to Interstate 8. This highway further facilitates commercial traffic and helps establish San Luis and Yuma County as a desirable location for commercial border crossings and industrial development.
        </p>
        <p> 
            The route &#40;State Route 195&#41;, locally known as the Area Service Highway &#40;<abbr title="area service highway">ASH</abbr>&#41; or Robert A. Vaughan Expressway, is designed to expedite commercial traffic flow between the United States and Mexico by channeling large tractor-trailers through the new Port of Entry.  
        </p>
        <p>
            And while construction lags on the Mexico side have delayed the port's opening, the highway provides a more direct route for motorists traveling between the border and east Yuma and the Foothills. More immediately, the road should ease traffic congestion in Yuma by diverting the commercial tractor-trailers that currently travel on Yuma streets on the way to an Interstate 8 linkup. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Planning for <abbr title="arizona state route">SR</abbr> 195 began in the early 1990s. In January 1999, an intergovernmental agreement was approved between <abbr title="arizona department of transportation">ADOT</abbr>, Yuma County, the cities of Yuma and San Luis, the town of Wellton, and the Cocopah Tribe. In 2000, voters approved <strong>$13.15M USD</strong> in local funding as part of the Yuma County Capital Improvement half-cent sales tax, which has since been retired. The total cost of the 26-mile highway was <strong>$92M USD</strong>. Work began on the <abbr title="arizona state route">SR</abbr> 195 in late 2007, and sections of the road became open to travel as they were completed. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The corridor from Yuma north through Bullhead City is a very different picture. This portion of the US/AZ 95 corridor is subject to extreme seasonal variations in segments, with heavy tourist use during the winter months. While the road condition is adequate for the low traffic load periods of each year, the virtually complete lack of four-lane sections and passing lanes renders the highways unacceptable for commercial usage at any time of the year, but particularly during the tourist season.
        </p>
        <p>
            As there are no current plans to provide reasonable numbers of either four-lane sections or passing lanes in the foreseeable future, the lack of a viable north/south commercial corridor for the District is unlikely to be remedied.
        </p>
        <p>
            Communities lacking adequate access to the Interstate corridors include Parker, Bullhead City, Lake Havasu City, and Colorado City. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The East/West transportation corridors give the District's communities an opportunity for more diversified industrial development. Interstates 8, 10, and 40 provide quick access by truck to the major urban centers of Phoenix, Los Angeles, and San Diego, and the ports associated with Los Angeles and San Diego. Through La Paz County, East/West rail lines, Kingman and Yuma also provide critical market access. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Conversely, lack of interstate and rail access creates difficulties for development in Bullhead City, Lake Havasu, and other District communities. North/South transportation corridors are not as advantageous.
