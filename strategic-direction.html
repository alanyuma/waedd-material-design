            The District fully supports the <a href="https://eda.gov/about/investment-priorities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> EDA Investment Policy Guidelines</a> for evaluating proposed EDA investments. Regional investments will meet or exceed the following guidelines: 
          </p>
        <p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Align with EDA’s investment priorities,</li>
                  <li>Effectively address the creation and/or retention of high-quality jobs, and</li>
                  <li>Document that the applicant can or will leverage other resources, both public and private, and Demonstrate the applicant’s capacity to commence the proposed project promptly, to use funds quickly and effectively, and provide a clear scope of work that includes a description of specific, measurable project outputs.</li>
                </ul>
          <p>
            EDA’s investment priorities provide an overarching framework to ensure its grant investment portfolio – ranging from planning to infrastructure construction -- contributes to local efforts to build, improve, or better leverage economic assets that allow businesses to succeed and regional economies to prosper and become more resilient. Competitive grant applications will be responsive to the evaluation criteria listed under each individual funding announcement, including at least one of the following investment priorities:

                <strong>1. Equity:</strong> Economic development planning or implementation projects that advance equity across America through investments that directly benefit:
              </p>

              </p> 
              <p>
                2&#41; underserved communities within geographies that have been systemically and/or systematically denied a full opportunity to participate in aspects of economic prosperity such as Tribal Lands, Persistent Poverty Counties, and rural areas with demonstrated, historical underservice.
